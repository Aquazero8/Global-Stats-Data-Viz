# Global Data Visualizations
The project leverages D3 libraries to visualize the various stats for countries around the fold


There's a data folder in this repository where you should place the downloaded CSV file. The data folder contains a country_regions.csv file which you will use to map the countries to their geographic regions (Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, etc.).
